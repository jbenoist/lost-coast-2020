Our permit is `North` to `South` over `4 nights`, which should be plenty. This direction allegedly provides tail winds most of the way. Google maps claims that a `4h23` drive is necessary to reach the southern trailhead where we will be dropping the first car. From there, we will be driving the second car for another `1h50` to the northern trailhead.
